/**
 * money-path.integration.spec.ts — the CONSUMER-SIDE gate.
 *
 * Why this exists (2026-08-25). Until now the backend's entire CI gate was
 * `tsc + build + unit`. No database, no HTTP, no order. That gap is not academic:
 *
 *  • The Medusa 2.17.2 -> 2.19.0 upgrade (68 packages, the whole commerce engine) could not be
 *    verified by CI at all. It went green while nothing had ever created a cart.
 *  • The auto-merge workflow had already QUEUED that upgrade for an unattended production deploy.
 *    The only thing that stopped it was an unrelated red test. An accident, not a control.
 *  • `seller-catalog-query.unit.spec.ts` used to run our query through Medusa's own translator —
 *    the one spec that proved MEDUSA agrees our payload is valid, rather than proving we built the
 *    payload we meant to build. 2.19 made that function private and it had to be deleted. Its
 *    consumer-side proof was explicitly owed here.
 *
 * The original defect this whole area guards against is instructive: a spec pinned
 * `context` + `withDeleted` against a FAKE `graph` that accepts any object. It passed for months
 * while every real call threw `Trying to query by not existing property Product.context`. A mock
 * cannot refuse a payload the real engine refuses — which is exactly why this tier runs against a
 * real Postgres and a real HTTP surface, and why it is worth the CI minutes.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately the MONEY PATH and nothing else. This is a gate, not a test suite:
 * a publishable key resolves to exactly one sales channel, a cart is created on it, a real variant
 * is priced, and the totals add up. Those are the invariants an engine upgrade can silently break.
 *
 * Runs only under `TEST_TYPE=integration:http` (see jest.config.js) against the Postgres + Redis
 * service containers in ci.yml. It is NOT part of `test:unit`, which must stay DB-free and fast.
