/**
 * market-medusa.ts — the seam between the pure market registry and THIS repo's
 * Medusa environment.
 *
 * `markets.ts` deliberately holds no Medusa Region id and no Sales Channel id: those
 * differ per environment (local / staging / production), so an id in the registry
 * would be a lie everywhere but one place (epic README, D2). This file is where a
 * market code becomes a concrete Medusa id, and it does it by reading an INJECTED
 * env object — never `process.env` directly — so every branch is unit-testable with
 * no ambient environment and no container.
 *
 * THREE STATES, NEVER TWO. `resolveMarketplaceChannelId('us')` and
 * `resolveMarketplaceChannelId('mx')` in an environment that forgot to set
 * `MEDUSA_SALES_CHANNEL_ID` both produce "no id", but they are completely different
 * facts:
 *   · `us`  — known-absent. There is no US Sales Channel and no US Region in ANY
 *             environment (D0: production holds exactly 1 Region and 2 Sales
 *             Channels, all Mexico). US is fail-closed by construction.
 *   · `mx` with the env var missing — UNCONFIGURED. An operator mistake. The
 *             marketplace exists; we simply cannot address it.
 * Collapsing those into one `null` is how a misconfigured deploy would read as
 * "this market has no marketplace" and quietly serve nothing while looking healthy.
 * The `*Resolution` functions keep them apart; the `*Id` helpers below are the
 * convenience shape the build contract asks for and are defined in terms of them.
 *
 * OPERATING CHANNEL (owned-shop-operating-channel epic, D2/S1.2): a SECOND Sales
 * Channel per market, added alongside `marketplace_channel` through the exact same
 * seam and the exact same three states. Marketplace membership means "published to
 * the country marketplace"; operating-channel membership means "buyable at all"
 * (cart/checkout/publishable-key resolve against it, starting Sprint 2). The two
 * channels are DIFFERENT Medusa resources with different ids — `unconfigured` on one
 * NEVER falls back to the other's id. Doing so would silently sell an owned-shop-only
 * product through the marketplace channel (or vice versa), which erases the whole
 * distinction this epic exists to create; a missing operating channel must read as an
 * outage, not as "use whatever channel we do have".
