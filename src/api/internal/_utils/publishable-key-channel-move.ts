/**
 * publishable-key-channel-move.ts — the pure planner behind
 * `/internal/publishable-key-channel-move` (owned-shop-operating-channel epic, S2.1).
 *
 * ── WHAT IT DECIDES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Which publishable API key is the storefront's, and exactly which channel links to
 * dismiss and create so that the key ends up holding **exactly one** channel: the
 * market's OPERATING channel. Link rows 1 → 1, never 1 → 2 → 1, never 2.
 *
 * ── WHY EXACTLY ONE, MEASURED IN MEDUSA 2.15.3'S OWN SOURCE ────────────────────
 * The scaffolded plan said "link the key to the operating channel IN ADDITION to the
 * marketplace channel". Traced through the installed packages, that is a total
 * checkout outage:
 *
 *   1. `@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/store/carts/middlewares.js` puts
 *      `maybeAttachPublishableKeyScopes` then `ensurePublishableKeyAndSalesChannelMatch`
 *      on `POST /store/carts`.
 *   2. `@medusajs/medusa/dist/api/utils/middlewares/common/ensure-pub-key-sales-channel-match.js`
 *      — with `pubKeySalesChannels.length > 1` and no `sales_channel_id` in the body —
 *      pushes "Cannot assign sales channel to cart. The Publishable API Key in the
 *      header has multiple associated sales channels." onto `req.errors` and calls
 *      `next()`. It does NOT set `validatedBody.sales_channel_id`.
 *   3. `@medusajs/framework/dist/http/utils/wrap-handler.js` — which
 *      `@medusajs/framework/dist/http/router.js` wraps EVERY route handler in —
 *      short-circuits on `req.errors.length` with **HTTP 400**
 *      `{ errors, message: "Provided request body contains errors…" }`.
 *
 * So every cart creation from the storefront 400s. (The epic README's D3 predicted a
 * *silent* fallback to `store.default_sales_channel_id` via
 * `@medusajs/core-flows/dist/cart/steps/find-sales-channel.js`; that step does hold
 * exactly that fallback, but it is unreachable here because `wrapHandler` answers
 * first. The conclusion is unchanged and the reason is stronger: two channels on this
 * key means nobody can check out at all.)
 *
 * The storefront never sends `sales_channel_id` — there is no call site in
 * `apps/miyagisanchez` — so there is no code path that avoids step 2. A single-channel
 * key makes the failure unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely.
 *
 * ── ROLLBACK (epic README, D9) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Two link operations, not a deploy: re-run this planner with the MARKETPLACE channel
 * as the desired set, i.e. POST `{ dry_run: false, desired_channel: "marketplace" }`.
 * The key returns to exactly one link row pointing at `MEDUSA_SALES_CHANNEL_ID` and
 * the catalog is byte-identical to today's. Operating-channel product memberships are
 * left in place — they are inert the moment the key points elsewhere.
 *
 * Pure over injected rows, so every refusal is unit-testable with no container and no
 * database. The I/O shell is the route.
