/**
 * The Stripe Connect return URL must point at a route that EXISTS.
 *
 * It pointed at `/sell/pagos`, which is not a route in the storefront: payment
 * settings live under `/shop/manage/settings/`, and `/sell/*` is the listing wizard.
 * A seller who completed Connect onboarding was handed straight to a 404 — at the end
 * of the flow that decides whether they can take money at all. The `refresh_url` case
 * is worse, because that is where Stripe sends someone whose link already expired.
 *
 * Nothing failed loudly. The account was created, the link was valid, Stripe did
 * exactly as asked. Only the destination was wrong.
 *
 * ── Why this spec is shaped like this ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The two halves live in DIFFERENT REPOSITORIES. `apps/miyagisanchez` is its own git
 * repo, gitignored from this one, so in CI this repo is checked out alone and the
 * storefront tree is simply not there.
 *
 * THREE STATES, never two. A spec that silently skipped when the sibling is missing
 * would be green having checked nothing — worse than no spec, because it reads as a
 * passing gate (AGENTS.md rule 5). So:
 *
 *   · sibling PRESENT  → resolve the path against the real `app/` route tree;
 *   · sibling ABSENT   → say so out loud, and still assert everything checkable in
 *                        isolation (the namespace, and that the literal has not
 *                        regressed to the known-bad value).
