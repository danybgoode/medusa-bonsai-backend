/**
 * `payment_captured` — the honest "did the money actually land?" answer
 * (miyagisanchezcommerce#298, fresh-reviewer finding).
 *
 * The bug this guards against is subtle and was live: `status` is NOT an assertion of
 * capture. It initialises to 'paid' and is only demoted for cancel/refund/return or an
 * uncaptured MANUAL method — so an automatic order sitting at `payment_status:
 * 'authorized'` normalises to 'paid'. A consumer reading `status === 'paid'` as "we have
 * the money" is reading a fall-through default.
 *
 * That is harmless for the seller order list this route was written for, and NOT harmless
 * for the merchant-lifecycle projection, whose `first_sale` milestone is write-once and
 * unwithdrawable. The FIRST test below is the load-bearing one: it fails against the
 * pre-fix behaviour of inferring capture from `status`.
