/**
 * Read-only Supabase client for GCP-hosted personalization reads.
 *
 * Boundary note (AGENTS rule #2): Supabase owns the non-commerce marketplace data
 * (favorites / offers / conversations) and the FRONTEND owns all WRITES to it. This
 * client is READ-ONLY — the marketplace-static-shell epic moved the homepage's
 * personalization read onto Cloud Run, so the backend reads (never writes) that data
 * here, with the frontend's service-role key. Supabase stays the source of truth.
 *
 * Lazy singleton + missing-config stub mirror the frontend `lib/supabase.ts`, so a
 * build/runtime without the env vars degrades to "no rows" instead of crashing.
 *
 * `realtime.transport` stub: `createClient()` unconditionally constructs a
 * `RealtimeClient` (a `SupabaseClient` constructor side effect with no opt-out),
 * which looks up a native `WebSocket` global if no `transport` is given —
 * absent on this Dockerfile's `node:20-slim` (native WebSocket landed in
 * Node 22), so every call THROWS at client-construction time, caught by the
 * lazy singleton's caller-side try/catch as "no rows" everywhere this client
 * is used — including `src/lib/flags.ts`'s `platform_flags` read, which
 * silently fell back to `DEFAULT_FLAGS` on every single request regardless
 * of the live DB value (found live via the catalog-management epic's Sprint
 * 3 smoke test — `catalog.bulk_enabled` stayed 423 even confirmed `true` in
 * Supabase). This client never calls `.channel()`/`.subscribe()` anywhere in
 * this codebase (grepped), so the realtime socket is never actually opened —
 * a no-op transport stub satisfies the constructor's type + skips the
 * WebSocket-constructor lookup entirely, with zero loss of real capability.
