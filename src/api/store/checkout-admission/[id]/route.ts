/**
 * GET /store/checkout-admission/:id?market=mx
 *
 * The CHECKOUT admission seam (owned-shop-operating-channel epic, D7 · S2.3). It
 * answers exactly one question: *is this product a member of this market's OPERATING
 * channel, and therefore buyable?* The rules, the three fail-closed states and the
 * reasoning all live in `../../_utils/checkout-admission.ts` — read that header
 * before changing anything here. This file is only the I/O shell.
 *
 * ── WHO CALLS IT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The storefront's `lib/cart.ts` → `resolveCheckoutLines`, in place of
 * `GET /store/listings/:id?market=mx`, when `catalog.owned_shop_only_enabled` is ON.
 * `GET /store/listings/:id` is UNTOUCHED and still means marketplace-publication
 * truth (epic E3).
 *
 * ── RESPONSE (200) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   {
 *     "market_code": "mx",              // the market echo the storefront confirms
 *     "admitted": true,
 *     "owned_shop_only_enabled": true,  // which rule actually ran
 *     "product": {
 *       "id": "prod_…",
 *       "medusa_product_id": "prod_…",  // same value; see below
 *       "status": "published",
 *       "in_operating_channel": true,
 *       "in_marketplace_channel": false
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * `medusa_product_id` duplicates `id` because the caller's admission proof compares
 * BOTH against the id it asked about — the productId/variantId divergence lesson in
 * `resolveCheckoutLines`' own comments is why the proof checks two fields rather than
 * trusting one. Keeping the pair here means the storefront's predicate stays the same
 * shape when it swaps endpoints.
 *
 * Every product-level refusal is one indistinguishable **404 `{"message":"Listing not
 * found"}`** — the same body and the same reasoning as `/store/listings/:id`: a
 * checkout gate is not entitled to tell a caller which of its rules it tripped, and a
 * refusal that named the rule would turn this into a catalog-enumeration oracle.
 * Market-level refusals return the structured `unavailable` body (400 / 404 / 503).
 *
 * ── IS THIS AN IDOR? NO — AND HERE IS THE ARGUMENT ─────────────────────────────
 * The route takes a caller-supplied product id, so the check must be per-object, and
 * it is: publish state, hidden-product state, OPERATING-channel membership and the
 * OWNING SELLER's market are all proven against the row itself, never against
 * anything the caller asserted. What a successful answer reveals — "this product is
 * buyable in mx" — is precisely what `GET /store/products/:id` already reveals under
 * the same publishable key once the key resolves through the operating channel (D3).
 * It is not new information; it is the same information with the rule stated. Nothing
 * seller-private is read out: the owning seller's row is consulted ONLY for
 * `metadata.operating_market`, through `readSellerOperatingMarket`, and never echoed.
 *
 * ── THE OWNING SELLER MUST BE ACTIVE (tenant-lifecycle-admin · D2b) ────────────
 * A paused or deleted shop is refused here, per-object, against the owning seller's
 * own row. This is the money-path GUARANTEE and it is deliberately redundant with
 * the mechanism — pausing also unlinks the seller's products from every market
 * channel, which removes them from the catalog by construction. If a link ever
 * lingers, checkout still refuses. An unreadable status refuses too.
 *
 * ── THE FLAG IS NOT THE AUTHORIZATION (AGENTS rule 5) ──────────────────────────
 * `catalog.owned_shop_only_enabled` decides WHICH RULE runs (operating-only, or
 * operating AND marketplace as today). Both rules are per-object authorization
 * checks. This is a Golden-managed KILLSWITCH with an ON default: the live
 * feature is available by default, and an explicit OFF value is the deliberate
 * protective rollback. A missing/unavailable Golden definition still uses the
 * declared local default and therefore preserves the live ON behavior.
